1. Math.Random() : The randomness generated by Math.random() might not be suitable for security-critical applications or cryptographic purposes, as the sequence it produces is deterministic and can be predicted if the initial seed is known.
2. SecureRandom : It provides a cryptographically secure way to generate random numbers. It is designed to be suitable for security-sensitive applications and cryptographic operations. SecureRandom uses unpredictable data sources to seed its initial state, making it resistant to prediction attacks.
